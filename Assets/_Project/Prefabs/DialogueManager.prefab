  - Count Hexley... today your reign of terror comes to an end.
  - 100 years have passed and 100 more will pass. Victory is defeat. My bones and
    my spirit still await liberation from these walls.
  - I know you, warrior of my lineage. I know all those who came before you, and
    I know all those to whom you will make way.
  - You will suffer the same fate as them and turn against those who come after you.
  - You will end up imprisoned like me.
  - But hope is my only remedy, and I still have enough light within me to bequeath
    my poetry to you.
  - She will guide you through the darkness of these walls so that you may prevail.
  - The alphabet has always fascinated me, and the letters that make it up have a
    hidden meaning.
  - " \u201CW\u201D represents moving upward, advancing despite adversity."
  - "\u201CS\u201D represents backing away from what seems too daunting in order
    to come back stronger."
  - "\u201CA\u201D and \u201CD\u201D represent choosing different paths. When two
    options are presented, either left or right."
  - Show me what you understand about my poetry.
  - You have the soul of a poet.
  - Sometimes letters come together and words take on a much deeper meaning.
  - The "SPACE" represents the time or distance that separates us from victory. All
    that is needed is to defeat one's enemy with the sword.
  - And finally, "SHIFT"represents change, the transformation from one state to another.
    Matter that transforms in a strange way to produce lightning.
  - Finally, I want to tell you one last thing before you go in to carry out your
    mission.
  - Your deceased brothers break swords and shields that they themselves can no longer
    hold in their hands with a single blow.
  - Perhaps you will be able to find the ones that once belonged to them, now broken
    into pieces.
  - And adventurous. Magic too consumes itself in the air. Lightning is fleeting
    and its trail is straight. But its power can be acquired at the cost of great
    danger.
